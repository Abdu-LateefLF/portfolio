        I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph, driven
        by a passion for building impactful and innovative solutions. My
        experience spans developing AI-powered applications, full-stack web
        platforms, and mobile games, utilizing technologies like Java, Python,
        and JavaScript. I have a strong grasp of data structures, algorithms,
        and software design, which I apply to create efficient and scalable
        systems. Constantly striving to grow, I'm looking for internship or
        full-time opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects
        and collaborate with forward-thinking teams.
