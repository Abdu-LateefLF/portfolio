      <p>
        I'm a software engineering student passionate about building real-world applications
        that make an impact. From creating an AI-controlled game in Unity to developing
        full-stack web apps with Node.js and React, I thrive on turning ideas into functional
        projects. Whether it’s optimizing backend systems or crafting responsive front-end
        interfaces, I’m always eager to learn, improve, and contribute. Currently
        seeking opportunities to apply my skills in internships or web development roles,
        and excited to collaborate on innovative projects.
